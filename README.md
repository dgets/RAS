# RecScan
## Utility to search, modify, and/or extract contents from potentially recursive archived messes

I had started work on this project, but didn't look enough into the API of the Apache commons compress library that I'm using for archival/compression utility.  Turns out I was recreating the wheel all over the place, so I just decided to scrap the old project and start it out again new.

More will be written here as the details in the code work themselves out.
